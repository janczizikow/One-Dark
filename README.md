# One Dark for Sublime Babel [![VS Code marketplace button](http://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs/joshpeng.theme-onedark-sublime.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.theme-onedark-sublime)
Proper port of Atom's One Dark theme for Visual Studio Code.

Optimized for use with [Sublime Babel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode). All other JS grammars are either incorrect or incomplete.

| Grammar                                  | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sublime Babel                            | Complete and correct grammar syntax highlighting |
| JavaScript Atom Grammar                  | Very poor JSX support                    |
| Babel ES6/ES7                            | Severely mis-scoped grammar resulting in an overuse of reds |
| Latest TypeScript and JavaScript Grammar | The worst option. Heavy red/grey-outs due to use of non-standard scoping |



## Screenshots

All other One Dark extensions suffer from severe red-outs, poor React/JSX support, and significant incorrect colors.

This extension brings back the colors like how they were meant to be from Atom :]
