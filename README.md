# One Dark for Sublime Babel
Proper port of Atom's One Dark theme for Visual Studio Code. Optimized for use with [Sublime Babel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode).


## Screenshots
All other One Dark extensions suffer from severe red-outs.

This extension brings back the colors like how they were meant to be from Atom :]
